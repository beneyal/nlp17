The
Talmudic
story
of
Akhnaiâs
oven
is
one
of
the
most
famous
andÂ
misunderstood
texts
of
the
Jewish
tradition.Â
One
of
its
major
themes
is
that
Jewish
religious
decisions
are
made
through
majority
rule
and
no
longer
through
divine
revelation.Â
However
another
major
theme
is
that
abusing
others
–
in
this
case
dissenters
–
is
an
offense
against
God.Â
This
broader
cautionary
message
of
the
story
is
too
often
ignored
.
The
part
of
the
story
usually
quoted
is
found
in
the
Babylonian
Talmud
Tractate
Bava
Metzia
59b.Â
Rabbi
Eliezer
ben
Hyrcanus
repeatedly
invokes
divine
miracles
and
even
Godâs
direct
intervention
to
make
his
point
to
his
colleagues
that
he
is
correct
about
a
specific
matter
of
Jewish
law.Â
Each
time
he
does
this
the
other
sages
reject
his
methods
of
proof.Â
Finally
when
God
declares
that
Rabbi
Eliezer
is
correct
they
respond
that
since
the
Torah
is
no
longer
in
heaven
but
given
to
us
on
earth
we
no
longer
listen
to
heavenly
authority
when
we
make
religious
rulings.Â
At
the
end
of
the
story
Elijah
the
prophet
famously
informs
the
rabbis
that
God
laughed
joyously
when
they
rejected
Godâs
arguments
declaring
âMy
children
have
defeated
Me
!
â
The
story
emphasizes
the
rabbisâ
inventive
bold
assertion
of
their
human
interpretive
authority
over
the
Torah
as
deeply
religious
people
committed
to
Torah
.
Yet
its
larger
literary
and
halakhic
context
(
Bava
Metzia
58b-59b
)
is
about
onaat
devarim
the
halakhic
prohibition
against
verbal
oppression
what
we
might
call
verbal
bullying.Â
Right
after
this
story
the
Talmud
relates
how
Eliezerâs
colleagues
declare
everything
he
ruled
ritually
pure
to
be
impure
then
publicly
excommunicate
him.Â
The
narrator
explains
repeatedly
that
Eliezerâs
cries
of
pain
from
being
abused
reach
God
resulting
in
death
and
destruction
in
the
world
so
great
is
Godâs
empathy
with
people
wronged
by
words.Â
The
text
at
one
point
does
argue
that
majority
rule
and
unanimity
are
so
vital
to
communal
solidarity
they
at
times
warrant
draconian
punishments
for
dissenters.Â
However
that
theme
is
dwarfed
by
the
Talmudâs
more
forceful
message
decrying
mistreatment
of
others
especially
those
who
disagree
with
the
majority
.
(
My
colleague
Professor
Jeffrey
Rubenstein
carefully
analyzes
the
entire
story
in
his
excellent
book
Talmudic
Stories
from
The
Johns
Hopkins
University
Press
1999
.
)
A
culture
of
dialogue
in
which
dissentersâ
rights
are
treated
respectfully
by
the
majority
is
obviously
critical
to
the
health
and
strength
of
democracies.Â
The
story
of
Akhnaiâs
oven
emphasizes
that
the
promotion
of
civil
disagreement
is
also
critical
to
the
health
of
the
Jewish
people.Â
Michael
Kay
an
American
Jewish
educator
and
education
scholar
talks
about
the
vital
role
that
education
for
critical
thinking
and
civil
discourse
can
play
in
helping
students
to
prepare
themselves
for
contemporary
Jewish
and
general
life
.
He
cites
studies
indicating
how
exposure
to
and
relationships
with
those
with
whom
you
disagree
or
who
are
different
from
you
â
what
he
calls
interactional
pluralism
–
actually
strengthens
personal
Jewish
identity
and
values
.
(
See
http
:
//www.jhub.org.uk/jdov/portfolio/the-paradox-of-pluralism-diversity-as-the-foundation-of-community/
)
.
Interactional
pluralism
creates
educational
environments
in
which
people
listen
to
one
another
argue
passionately
but
respectfully
sharpen
personal
perspectives
and
critical
thinking
and
most
important
learn
to
live
in
peace
with
each
other.Â
This
actually
describes
Jewish
Â
tradition
at
its
best
and
broadest
howbeit
in
a
contemporary
context
.
To
demonstrate
interactional
pluralism
at
work
Dr.
Kay
tells
a
story
about
a
student
of
his
who
discovered
that
his
future
freshman
roommate
at
college
had
posted
virulently
anti-Israel
literature
on
Facebook
.
When
he
called
the
college
to
ask
for
a
change
of
rooming
assignment
his
request
was
denied.Â
Educated
in
an
actively
pluralistic
school
environment
the
young
man
called
the
roommate
to
introduce
himself
and
to
explain
why
he
felt
passionately
about
Israel
and
Her
safety.Â
The
two
freshmen
had
a
thoughtful
discussion
about
history
politics
and
media
bias
and
later
on
the
roommate
actually
removed
the
postings
out
of
deference
to
his
new
friend.Â
They
had
reached
a
level
of
constructive
dialogue
in
part
because
this
student
had
internalized
the
philosophy
of
interactional
pluralism
in
a
distinctive
Jewish
context.Â
He
employed
it
successfully
to
influence
someone
to
think
more
critically
and
to
be
more
sensitive
about
how
others
feel
about
Israel.Â
The
Jewish
community
could
afford
to
take
a
page
out
of
this
young
manâs
playbook
as
one
framework
for
our
own
most
difficult
internal
conversations
.
Dr.
Kayâs
story
and
our
Talmudic
narrative
underscore
that
interactional
pluralism
is
more
than
an
educational
or
debate
strategy.Â
It
is
a
vital
Jewish
value
which
establishes
a
baseline
of
decency
and
civility
for
discussion
and
disagreement.Â
Pluralism
is
not
equivalent
to
relativism
and
an
opinion
should
not
be
treated
as
valid
merely
for
the
sake
of
catch-all
inclusiveness
.
Â
Â
Thoughtful
people
should
be
able
to
subject
it
to
rigorous
analysis
and
scrutiny
and
then
to
validate
or
discredit
it.Â
Yet
discrediting
an
idea
does
not
give
a
community
carte
blanche
to
ostracize
the
person
who
holds
it
.
Â
Â
As
a
historically
marginalized
minority
that
has
built
or
helped
to
build
two
model
democracies
we
Jews
understand
the
supreme
danger
of
onaat
devarim
as
a
form
of
public
policy.Â
Further
with
a
critically
thinking
tradition
full
of
cautionary
tales
like
Akhnaiâs
oven
we
know
that
bullying
dissenters
can
be
ethically
intellectually
and
politically
self-destructive
.
Though
they
used
their
colleagues
as
their
models
the
rabbinic
storytellers
of
the
Talmud
were
unsparing
in
their
criticism
of
any
Jewish
person
or
leader
who
speaks
abusively
towards
others.Â
Their
message
for
our
balkanized
Jewish
community
today
is
loud
harsh
and
clear
:
Â
we
need
to
learn
to
disagree
civilly
and
kindly
with
one
another
.
We
need
to
avoid
onaat
devarim
when
conducting
authentic
Jewish
debates
whether
we
are
talking
about
Israel
religious
values
or
the
Jewish
communityâs
future.Â
Refusal
to
do
so
is
the
moral
equivalent
of
putting
our
heads
into
an
oven
.
