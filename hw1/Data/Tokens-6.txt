Every
legal
tradition
has
its
rational
and
orderly
parts
like
our
IRC
.
And
its
more
arcane
and
puzzling
doctrines
understandable
only
with
a
heavy
dose
of
history
like
the
two
peppercorns
of
contract
law
or
the
issue
of
who
owns
a
wetland
parcel
subject
to
a
springing
reversionary
interest
and
five
years
behind
in
its
tax
assessment
.
And
the
parts
that
must
simply
be
taken
on
faith
and
are
not
subject
to
rational
analysis
at
all
like
the
holding
that
the
Civil
War
Amendments
gave
the
railroads
constitutional
rights
against
the
state
legislatures
.
And
then
there
are
the
stories
sometimes
half
mythological
and
the
great
turning
events
that
don’t
always
even
appear
in
the
law
books
:
the
repeal
of
the
No
Standing
Army
Clause
after
the
Second
World
War
and
the
discovery
of
the
President’s
inherent
right
to
wage
war
in
Indochina
are
two
that
one
of
my
collegues
has
made
famous
.
Perhaps
we
are
in
the
middle
of
one
right
now
that
later
will
be
seen
as
the
end
of
the
separation
of
powers
and
the
introduction
of
the
no-confidence
motion
to
American
politics
.
I
leave
it
to
you
to
place
the
story
we
are
about
to
examine
.
Akhnai
is
a
mysterious
word
in
Hebrew
as
well
as
in
English
and
the
story
begins
with
a
question
about
what
it
means
.
It
is
not
from
the
great
rationalizing
tradition
of
Jewish
jurisprudence
in
style
yet
it
is
critical
to
it
in
substance
.
The
source
of
the
text
is
the
Talmud
.
The
West’s
Reporter
of
the
first
six
centuries
after
the
destruction
of
the
Temple
.
Or
better
yet
class
notes
from
the
academies
.
The
first
hypertext
.
The
context
:
The
generation
after
the
destruction
of
the
Temple
.
Biblical
Judaism
centered
around
King
and
Temple
priests
and
sacrifices
agriculture
and
the
Land
of
Israel
is
in
crisis
.
The
Romans
have
destroyed
King
and
Temple
.
Sacrifices
are
ended
.
Much
of
the
people
is
in
exile
and
more
will
be
soon
.
Much
of
the
law
given
at
Sinai
seems
obviously
irrelevant
:
why
keep
pure
to
enter
the
Temple
if
there
is
no
Temple
to
enter
?
A
thousand
year
conflict
over
the
nature
of
sacrifice
and
the
substitutes
for
it
--
prayer
and
pursuit
of
justice
--
has
been
resolved
by
force
majeur
.
Rabbi
Eliezer
who
witnessed
the
destruction
of
the
Temple
and
smuggled
his
teacher
out
of
besieged
Jerusalem
in
a
coffin
is
arguing
over
the
purity
of
an
oven
with
his
fellow
rabbis
.
It
is
a
simple
legal
issue
of
a
form
quite
familiar
to
all
of
us
:
Contact
with
dead
snakes
makes
food
impure
.
Ovens
and
vessels
generally
transmit
impurity
.
Broken
vessels
don’t
.
The
Oven
of
Akhnai
(
tanur
achnai
)
is
made
of
broken
pieces
cemented
together
.
Is
it
an
oven
or
is
it
a
broken
vessel
?
A
standard
interpretative
problem
of
the
type
that
arises
in
every
human
legal
system
every
day
.
How
do
we
decide
?
Looking
to
the
spirit
of
the
law
?
Trying
to
find
the
original
intent
?
The
spirit
is
that
we
keep
ourselves
pure
but
that
doesn’t
help
in
determining
if
this
particular
item
is
pure
.
The
original
intent
is
much
the
same
:
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
original
intent
was
with
regard
to
a
problem
that
has
never
arisen
.
Plain
meaning
--
that
doesn’t
help
;
you
can
read
the
words
over
and
over
and
still
the
rules
regarding
broken
items
say
it
is
kosher
and
the
rules
regarding
ovens
say
it
is
not
.
Eliezer
says
it
is
a
broken
vessel
:
once
broken
it
can
never
be
put
together
again
fully
.
Maybe
that
is
also
his
view
of
the
world
after
the
destruction
of
the
Temple
.
Maybe
not
though
.
On
that
day
R.
Eliezer
made
all
the
arguments
in
the
world
but
they
didn’t
accept
them
.
He
said
if
I
am
right
let
the
carob
tree
prove
it
...
He
presents
all
the
arguments
in
the
world
but
doesn’t
persuade
them
.
Logic
having
failed
he
moves
on
to
rhetoric
:
if
I
am
right
he
says
let
the
tree
prove
it
.
The
tree
flies
through
the
air
.
The
majority
says
we
don’t
accept
halakhic
--
legal
--
rulings
from
trees
.
Then
he
makes
the
stream
flow
backwards
.
Same
result
.
Then
he
orders
the
walls
of
the
synagogue
to
collapse
.
They
begin
to
fall
inward
but
Rabbi
Yehoshua
rebuked
them
saying
“If
Talmudic
Sages
argue
with
one
another
about
Halakhah
what
business
do
you
have
interfering
?
”
So
they
don’t
collapse
but
out
of
respect
for
R.
Eliezar
they
remain
leaning
.
Finally
logic
and
miracles
having
failed
R.
Eliezar
appeals
directly
to
Heaven
.
And
the
Bat
Kol
--
a
voice
from
Heaven
the
still
small
voice
that
spoke
in
the
wilderness
--
went
forth
saying
:
“Why
are
you
disputing
with
R.
Eliezar
for
the
Halakhah
is
accordance
with
him
everywhere”
.
Rabbi
Yehoshua
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
“It
is
not
in
Heaven”
(
Deut
30:12
)
Torah
was
already
given
on
Mt
.
Sinai
and
it
says
in
it
“Follow
the
majority’s
ruling”
(
Ex
.
23:2
)
.
So
we
do
not
obey
voices
from
Heaven
.
The
next
explains
that
R.
Natan
--
several
generations
later
--
met
Elijah
one
day
and
asked
what
happened
in
Heaven
at
that
time
:
God
he
is
told
smiled
and
said
“My
children
have
defeated
me
my
children
have
defeated
me.”
We
are
not
told
if
this
is
to
be
taken
straightforwardly
or
ironically
.
R.
Yehoshua’s
ruling
was
adopted
a
public
demonstration
of
the
impurity
of
the
food
cooked
in
the
oven
was
made
and
R.
Eliezar
despite
his
enormous
stature
was
excommunicated
for
rebelling
against
the
elders
.
Now
Eliezar
was
married
to
the
sister
of
R.
Gamliel
who
pronounced
the
ban
.
And
Eliezar’s
wife
then
prevented
Eliezar
from
saying
his
personal
supplicatory
prayers
for
many
years
until
one
day
when
she
got
the
calendar
wrong
and
thought
it
was
a
day
when
such
prayers
are
not
said
.
Gamliel
promptly
died
--
she
says
to
her
husband
--
you
have
killed
my
brother
.
But
lest
you
conclude
that
this
is
a
final
vindication
of
Eliezar
I
should
point
out
that
the
entire
story
is
in
interpretation
of
a
Mishnah
having
to
do
with
the
importance
of
respecting
those
with
whom
you
disagree
--
the
astonishing
disrespect
shown
to
Eliezar
not
his
ruling
is
the
basis
of
his
prayer’s
being
granted
.
The
authority
that
promulgated
the
law
has
spoken
.
The
text
does
not
question
the
authenticity
of
the
Bat
Kol
--
there
is
no
question
of
false
prophecy
.
And
the
Bat
Kol
says
both
that
Eliezar
is
right
here
and
that
he
is
always
right
.
Now
in
English
positivism
this
would
be
the
end
.
When
the
parliament
speaks
it
is
obeyed
.
If
it
contradicts
an
earlier
law
the
later
one
prevails
:
either
it
has
changed
its
mind
or
the
contradiction
is
an
illusion
but
in
either
case
parliament
prevails
over
the
judge
.
But
the
Oven
of
Akhnai
takes
the
opposite
view
.
The
law
is
not
in
Heaven
:
the
interpretation
of
Torah
we
were
told
on
Sinai
is
by
majority
rule
.
The
Rabbis
are
obliged
to
use
the
methods
of
interpretation
given
to
them
by
God
to
the
best
of
their
abilities
.
And
when
they
conclude
by
that
method
that
the
Oven
conveys
impurity
that
is
the
law
--
according
to
the
most
fundamental
principle
of
the
law
which
is
majority
rule
.
R.
Eliezar
is
wrong
--
because
he
insists
on
a
particular
result
in
violation
of
the
basic
procedural
principle
and
it
is
for
that
that
he
is
excommunicated
.
It
is
for
that
that
the
walls
accept
--
BOTH
Eliezar’s
ruling
AND
the
rebuke
that
miracles
are
not
an
acceptable
means
of
determining
the
law
.
And
it
is
for
that
recognition
that
God
smiles
:
his
children
have
understood
that
the
process
is
more
important
than
the
result
that
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
interpretive
system
as
a
human
system
speaking
to
human
reason
and
deciding
by
the
human
method
of
argument
and
persuasion
followed
by
a
vote
is
far
more
important
that
whether
the
Oven
is
kosher
.
The
Bat
Kol
then
which
by
definition
is
correct
is
wrong
:
``
my
children
have
bested
me
''
.
Why
the
irony
of
the
endings
?
Because
even
Eliezar
who
defied
the
basic
rule
of
civility
is
entitled
to
be
treated
civilly
and
he
was
not
.
Now
I
want
to
add
a
bit
more
to
the
story
and
then
I
will
let
you
talk
for
a
while
.
First
there
is
a
comment
here
about
law
and
interpretation
.
When
the
Torah
was
given
at
Sinai
it
came
with
13
methods
of
interpretation
and
49
arguments
proving
that
each
item
is
kosher
and
49
arguments
proving
that
it
is
not
.
Disagreement
and
the
limits
of
persuasion
are
part
of
the
human
condition
--
the
Torah
is
not
One
Law
but
Infinite
Law
from
One
God
who
is
also
Infinite
.
So
how
do
we
know
what
the
law
is
?
It
can
not
be
from
reading
the
text
let
alone
listening
to
the
tradition
or
even
Bat
Kols
.
It
is
as
the
Torah
teaches
us
by
following
the
majority
.
Second
there
is
a
message
about
the
nature
of
law
more
broadly
.
Genesis
you
recall
tells
us
that
God
“gave”
the
earth
and
its
flora
and
fauna
to
Adam
.
In
another
context
an
early
text
attempts
to
explain
what
that
gift
meant
.
One
of
several
answers
is
this
:
When
God
created
Adam
he
took
him
to
see
all
the
trees
of
the
Garden
of
Eden
and
said
to
him
:
See
how
good
they
are
.
Everything
that
I
have
created
I
created
for
you
.
Pay
attention
that
you
do
not
destroy
my
world
for
if
you
destroy
it
there
is
no
one
to
fix
it
afterwards
.
Ecclesiastes
Rabbah
6.28
The
same
I
think
is
true
of
the
law
.
The
law
is
not
self
maintaining
.
We
can
not
depend
on
the
original
authors
to
fix
it
for
us
if
we
screw
up
.
Indeed
it
is
a
mark
of
our
maturity
to
recognize
that
the
law
can
never
remove
from
us
the
responsibility
of
thinking
for
ourselves
:
on
that
day
My
children
grew
up
they
bested
Me
as
children
do
to
parents
when
they
reach
maturity
.
Or
as
another
Jewish
text
with
analogues
in
the
common
law
tradition
nicely
puts
it
:
They
the
earlier
thinkers
were
giants
and
we
are
but
midgets
.
But
we
are
midgets
standing
on
the
shoulders
of
giants
.
Nor
can
we
depend
on
interpretation
--
laws
are
not
self
explanatory
.
Interpretative
methods
are
loose
.
Right
and
wrong
answers
can
come
from
them
--
and
the
majority
can
get
it
wrong
as
the
majority
did
here
both
on
the
small
question
of
the
purity
of
the
Oven
and
on
the
large
question
of
how
to
treat
dissenters
.
But
still
we
must
follow
the
majority
.
And
the
majority
must
be
guided
by
a
firm
grasp
of
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
.
The
alternative
--
well
in
Jewish
law
there
is
no
alternative
.
In
life
the
alternative
is
as
the
Talmud
says
of
a
society
without
laws
that
``
people
will
eat
each
other
alive
.
''
Somehow
we
must
defeat
but
not
excommunicate
those
who
would
define
who
would
follow
simple
orders
they
think
they
have
received
rather
than
struggling
to
understand
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
in
a
complex
world
that
has
been
given
to
us
to
save
or
destroy
by
ourselves
.
And
we
must
do
it
without
much
help
from
sources
outside
.
