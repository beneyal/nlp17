Context
:
The
generation
after
the
destruction
of
the
Second
Temple
in
Jerusalem
.
Late
Biblical
Judaism
centered
around
the
(
questionable
)
Davidic
Monarchy
and
a
Temple
priests
and
sacrifices
agriculture
and
the
Land
of
Israel
is
in
crisis
.
The
Romans
have
abolished
the
monarchy
and
destroyed
the
Temple
.
The
entire
system
of
sacrifices
have
come
to
an
end
.
Much
of
the
Jewish
people
is
living
in
exile
scattered
around
the
region
and
more
will
be
soon
.
Much
of
the
law
given
at
Sinai
seems
obviously
irrelevant
:
why
maintain
the
system
of
ritual
purity
to
enter
the
Temple
if
there
is
no
Temple
to
enter
?
A
thousand
year
conflict
over
the
nature
of
sacrifice
and
the
substitutes
for
it
-
prayer
and
pursuit
of
justice
-
has
been
resolved
by
force
majeur
.
Nevertheless
the
Rabbis
main
aspects
of
the
system
of
ritual
purity
and
also
continually
reconstruct
Jewish
life
through
their
methods
of
interpretation
.
It
was
taught
elsewhere
:
If
one
cut
[
an
oven
]
into
sections
(
lit
.
vertebrae
)
and
placed
sand
between
every
section
-
[
What
is
the
ruling
?
]
Rabbi
Eliezer
rules
it
pure
and
the
Sages
rule
it
impure.This
is
the
“Oven
of
Achnai.”
What
is
Achnai
?
Said
Rabbi
Judah
in
the
name
of
Samuel
:
That
they
surrounded
it
with
words
[
of
debate
]
like
an
Achnai
snake
and
declared
it
impure
.
It
was
taught
:
On
that
day
Rabbi
Eliezer
answered
all
the
answers
on
earth
and
they
did
not
accept
it
from
him
.
He
said
“If
the
law
is
like
me
the
carob
tree
will
prove
it”
;
the
carob
tree
was
uprooted
from
its
place
one
hundred
cubits
some
say
four
hundred
cubits
.
They
said
:
“We
do
not
bring
proof
from
a
carob
tree.”
He
came
back
and
said
“If
the
law
is
like
me
the
water
channel
will
prove
it”
;
the
water
channel
flowed
in
reverse
direction
.
They
said
:
“We
do
not
bring
proof
from
a
water
channel.”
He
came
back
and
said
“If
the
law
is
as
I
say
the
walls
of
the
House
of
Study
will
prove
it”
;
the
walls
of
the
House
of
Study
inclined
to
fall
.
Rabbi
Joshua
protested
at
them
[
i.e
.
the
walls
]
saying
to
them
“If
scholars
defeat
each
other
in
the
law
how
does
it
benefit
you
?
”
They
did
not
fall
because
of
the
honor
of
Rabbi
Joshua
but
they
did
not
straighten
because
of
the
honor
of
Rabbi
Eliezer
and
still
they
incline
and
stand
.
[
Rabbi
Eliezer
]
came
back
and
said
“If
the
law
is
like
me
from
the
Heavens
they
will
prove
it”
;
a
heavenly
voice
came
out
and
said
“What
is
with
you
towards
Rabbi
Eliezer
for
the
law
is
like
him
in
every
instance
?
”
Rabbi
Joshua
stood
on
his
feet
and
said
“
[
The
Torah
]
is
not
in
heaven
”
(
Deuteronomy
30:12
)
.
What
does
``
[
The
Torah
]
is
not
in
heaven
''
mean
?
R.
Jeremiah
said
:
“Since
the
Torah
was
already
given
at
Sinai
we
do
not
pay
attention
to
a
heavenly
voice
since
You
already
wrote
at
Sinai
in
the
Torah
'After
the
majority
to
incline
'
(
Exodus
23:2
)
.
Rabbi
Nathan
met
the
prophet
Elijah
and
said
to
him
“What
did
the
Holy
Bountiful
One
do
in
that
hour
?
”
He
said
to
him
:
“He
smiled
and
said
“My
children
have
defeated
Me
My
children
have
defeated
Me.”
They
said
:
On
that
day
they
burned
all
the
pure
things
Rabbi
Eliezer
had
declared
pure
;
they
voted
regarding
him
and
excommunicated
him
.
They
asked
“Who
will
go
and
let
him
know
?
”
Rabbi
Akiva
said
“I
will
go
lest
an
improper
person
inform
him
and
all
the
earth
will
be
destroyed.”
What
did
Rabbi
Akiva
do
?
He
dressed
in
black
and
sat
before
him
at
a
distance
of
four
cubits
.
Rabbi
Eliezer
said
:
“Akiva
what
is
different
today
from
all
days
?
”
He
said
“My
master
it
seems
to
me
that
your
friends
distanced
themselves
from
you.”
Rabbi
Eliezer
too
tore
his
clothes
removed
his
shoes
and
sat
on
the
ground
his
eyes
flowed
tears
.
The
earth
was
stricken
a
third
in
olives
a
third
in
wheat
a
third
in
barley
.
Some
say
:
even
dough
in
a
woman’s
hand
spoiled
.
It
was
taught
:
Great
was
that
day
that
every
place
Rabbi
Eliezer
put
his
eyes
was
burned
.
And
even
Rabban
Gamliel
was
on
a
ship
;
a
wave
stood
upon
him
to
drown
him
.
He
said
:
It
appears
to
me
this
is
only
because
of
Rabbi
Eliezer
son
of
Hyrkanos
.
He
stood
on
his
feet
and
said
“Master
of
the
world
it
is
revealed
and
known
before
You
that
not
for
my
honor
I
did
nor
for
the
honor
of
my
father’s
house
but
for
Your
honor
that
controversies
not
multiply
in
Israel.”
The
sea
rested
from
its
anger
.
Ima
Shalom
the
wife
of
Rabbi
Eliezer
was
Rabban
Gamliel’s
sister
;
from
then
on
she
did
not
allow
Rabbi
Eliezer
to
fall
to
the
ground
in
prayer
.
One
day
the
New
Moon
became
miscalculated
for
her
between
a
twenty-nine
or
thirty
day
month
.
Some
say
:
a
poor
man
came
and
stood
at
the
gate
she
brought
out
bread
to
him
.
She
found
Rabbi
Eliezer
fallen
in
prayer
and
said
“Get
up
you
have
killed
my
brother.”
Meanwhile
a
ram’s
horn
blast
went
out
from
Rabban
Gamliel’s
house
[
to
announce
]
that
he
died
.
[
Rabbi
Eliezer
]
asked
“How
did
you
know
?
”
She
said
“So
I
have
received
a
tradition
from
the
house
of
my
father’s
father
:
“All
gates
are
closed
but
the
gates
of
oppression.”
It
is
not
in
the
Heavens
!
-
But
it
says
in
the
first
chapter
of
Yevamot
that
the
halachah
is
like
Beit
Hillel
because
a
Bat
Kol
went
out
.
It
is
different
here
because
he
come
to
be
divisive
about
the
words
of
Torah
as
it
is
written
``
After
the
majority
incline
``
but
there
on
the
contrary
.
Beit
Hillel
was
the
majority
;
if
we
had
doubts
we
would
have
gone
after
the
majority
in
the
name
of
Beit
Shammai
who
was
good
and
sharp
.
Furthermore
here
a
Bat
Kol
did
not
go
out
except
for
the
honor
of
Rabbi
Eliezer
who
said
``
Let
the
Heavens
bring
proof
!
''
But
it
said
there
the
Rabbi
Joshua
said
that
the
Bat
Kol
does
not
provide
guidance
and
we
do
not
listen
to
it
because
of
this
story
here
.
There
it
was
specifically
said
that
it
was
not
in
the
Heavens
that
the
Torah
was
already
given
to
us
from
Sinai
meaning
that
because
of
this
we
do
not
listen
to
the
Bat
Kol
.
God
smiled
and
said
My
children
have
defeated
me
-
But
it
said
in
the
beginning
of
Avodah
Zara
(
3b
)
:
On
the
day
the
Temple
was
destroyed
there
was
no
laughter
in
the
Holy
Bountiful
One
's
presence
which
was
established
but
here
it
was
speaking
of
mirth
in
general
.
Why
did
the
Rabbis
not
change
their
opinion
when
God
weighed
in
?
Are
the
Rabbis
right
to
rule
against
Rabbi
Eliezer
?
How
do
Rabbi
Joshua
and
Rabbi
Jeremiah
use
verses
quoted
from
the
Torah
to
support
their
position
?
Why
did
God
take
delight
in
a
decision
that
in
direct
conflict
with
God
's
ruling
?
Why
excommunicate
Rabbi
Eliezer
?
Are
they
right
to
do
so
?
What
do
you
make
of
Rabbi
Eliezer
's
responses
to
his
excommunication
?
Given

together
?
What
does
it
mean
to
trust
God
and
yet
allow
humans
to
interpret
God
's
message
and

If
you
shalt
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
Eternal
your
God
to
keep
God
's
commandments
and
God
's
statutes
which
are
written
in
this
book
of
the
Instruction
;
if
you
turn
to
the
Eternal
your
God
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
life-force
.
(
11
)
For
this
commandment
which
I
command
you
this
day
-
it
is
not
too
wondrous
for
you
neither
is
it
far
away
.
(
12
)
It
is
not
in
heaven
[
that
you
should
]
say
:
‘Who
will
go
up
for
us
to
the
Heavens
and
take
it
to
us
so
we
can
hear
it
and
do
it
?
’
(
13
)
Nor
is
it
across
the
sea
[
that
you
should
]
say
:
‘Who
shall
cross
the
sea
for
us
and
take
it
to
us
so
we
can
hear
it
and
do
it
?
’
(
14
)
But
the
matter
is
very
close
to
you
in
your
mouth
and
in
your
heart
to
do
it
.
