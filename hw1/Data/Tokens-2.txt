separate

[
of

Â—
such
an
oven
R.
Eliezer
declared
is
not
susceptible
to
defilement
while
the
sages
declared
it
susceptible
.
[
2
]
R.
Eliezer
brought
forward
every
imaginable
argument
but
the
Sages
did
not
accept
any
of
them
.
Finally
he
said
to
them
:
``
If
the
Halakhah
(
religious
law
)
is
in
accordance
with
me
let
this
carob
tree
prove
it
!
''
Sure
enough
the
carob
tree
immediately
uprooted
itself
and
moved
one
hundred
cubits
and
some
say
400
cubits
from
its
place
.
``
No
proof
can
be
brought
from
a
carob
said
to
them
``
If
the
Halakhah
agrees
with
me
let
the
channel
of
water
prove
it
!
''
Sure
enough
the
channel
of
water
flowed
backward
.
``
No
proof
can
be
brought
from
a
channel
of
water
``
they
rejoined
.
the
Halakhah
agrees
with
me
let
the
walls
of
the
house
of
study
prove
it
!
''
Sure
enough
the
walls
tilted
as
if
to
fall
.
But
R.
Joshua
rebuked
the
walls
saying
``
When
disciples
of
the
wise
are
engaged
in
a
halakhic
dispute
what
right
have
you
to
interfere
?
''
Hence
in
deference
to
R.
Joshua
they
did
not
fall
and
in
deference
to
R.
Eliezer
they
did
not
resume
their
upright
to
the
Sages
``
If
the
Halakhah
agrees
with
me
let
it
be
proved
from
heaven
.
''
Sure
enough
a
divine
voice
cried
out
``
Why
do
you
dispute
with
R.
Eliezer
with
whom
the
Halakhah
always
agrees
?
''
R.
Joshua
stood
up
and
protested
:
''
The
Torah
is
not
in
heaven
!
''
(
Deut
.
30:12
)
.
We
pay
no
attention
to
a
divine
voice
because
long
ago
at
Mount
Sinai
You
wrote
in
your
Torah
at
Mount
Sinai
`After
the
majority
must
one
incline
'
.
(
Ex
.
23:2
)
''
and
asked
him
``
What
did
the
Holy
One
do
at
that
moment
?
''
Elijah
:
''
He
laughed
[
with
joy
]
saying
'My
children
have
defeated
Me
My
children
each
portion
in
itself
is
not
a
utensil
and
the
sand
between
the
portions
prevents
the
oven
from
being
regarded
as
a
single
utensil
therefore
according
to
R.
Eliezer
the
oven
is
not
liable
to
defilement
.
The
sages
however
hold
that
the
oven
's
outer
coating
of
mortar
or
cement
unifies
the
coils
so
that
the
oven
is
liable
to
defilement
.
