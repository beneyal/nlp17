In
studying
Jewish
law
(
for
a
course
I
teach
on
legal
systems
very
different
from
ours
)
I
came
across
the
story
of
the
furnace
(
or
oven
)
of
Akhnai
.
In
brief
:
Rabbi
Eliezer
disputed
with
the
sages
as
to
whether
a
clay
oven
that
had
become
impure
had
been
broken
up
and
then
reassembled
with
sand
between
the
pieces
was
still
impure
or
having
been
broken
was
now
pure
.
After
he
offered
all
of
his
arguments
to
show
that
the
oven
was
now
pure
and
they
were
all
rejected
he
called
upon
a
carob
tree
to
prove
the
truth
of
his
position
.
The
carob
tree
promptly
uprooted
itself
and
was
flung
a
great
distance
away
.
The
sages
responded
that
a
carob
tree
had
nothing
to
say
in
the
disputes
of
legal
scholars
.
The
argument
continues
Eliezer
is
supported
by
two
more
miracles
each
of
which
the
sages
insist
is
irrelevant
.
Finally
he
asks
heaven
to
support
him
and
a
voice
form
heaven
announces
that
in
all
matters
of
the
law
Eliezer
is
correct
.
To
which
one
of
the
sages
replies
(
to
God
)
``
It
is
not
in
heaven
.
''
Or
in
other
words
``
butt
out
.
''
To
make
sense
of
the
story
so
far
one
needs
a
little
background
.
Jewish
law
like
any
system
based
on
divine
revelation
has
an
inherent
problem
with
maintaining
consistency
.
If
the
law
is
what
God
said
and
different
judges
have
different
interpretations
of
what
that
is
then
the
judges
will
give
different
rulings
on
the
same
question
.
What
God
said
is
not
determined
by
majority
vote
.
Early
on
the
legal
scholars
came
up
with
a
solution
to
this
problem
based
on
their
interpretation
of
a
passage
in
the
Torah
the
first
five
books
of
the
Old
Testament
.
What
God
said
was
something
that
each
legal
scholar
could
determine
for
himself
.
But
if
they
disagreed
what
the
law
was
was
determined
by
majority
vote
of
the
scholars
.
Better
that
they
risk
getting
the
law
wrong
than
that
they
end
up
disagreeing
in
their
judgments
.
A
scholar
who
disagreed
was
free
to
argue
for
his
position
but
when
functioning
as
a
judge
he
had
to
decide
according
to
the
view
that
had
been
established
by
the
majority
.
The
story
is
happening
at
the
end
of
a
period
of
several
generations
in
which
the
legal
scholars
were
divided
into
two
schools
the
school
of
Hillel
and
the
school
of
Shamai
which
disagreed
about
details
of
the
law
but
continued
to
each
treat
the
other
as
legitimate
.
Eliezer
was
a
leading
figure
in
the
school
of
Shamai
;
the
``
sages
''
in
the
story
are
scholars
of
the
school
of
Hillel
which
at
that
point
was
the
larger
of
the
two
.
The
point
of
the
first
part
of
the
story
is
that
even
if
Eliezer
was
correct
in
his
interpretation
of
the
law
what
the
law
was
was
determined
not
by
what
position
was
correct
but
by
what
position
was
supported
by
the
majority—and
the
majority
was
against
him
.
The
law
is
no
longer
in
heaven
to
be
determined
by
God
but
on
earth
having
been
given
by
God
to
the
legal
scholars
to
interpret
for
themselves
and
define
by
majority
vote
.
Having
rejected
divine
authority
as
a
basis
for
the
law—a
decision
which
according
to
another
bit
of
the
story
God
himself
approved
of—the
sages
went
on
to
put
Rabbi
Eliezer
under
ban
.
After
which
:
Said
they
'Who
shall
go
and
inform
him
?
'
'I
will
go
'
answered
R.
Akiba
'lest
an
unsuitable
person
go
and
inform
him
and
thus
destroy
the
whole
world
.
'
What
did
R.
Akiba
do
?
He
donned
black
garments
and
wrapped
himself
in
black
and
sat
at
a
distance
of
four
cubits
from
him
.
'Akiba
'
said
R.
Eliezer
to
him
'what
has
particularly
happened
to-day
?
'
'Master
'
he
replied
'it
appears
to
me
that
thy
companions
hold
aloof
from
thee
.
'
Thereupon
he
too
rent
his
garments
put
off
his
shoes
removed
[
his
seat
]
and
sat
on
the
earth
whilst
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes
.
The
world
was
then
smitten
:
a
third
of
the
olive
crop
a
third
of
the
wheat
and
a
third
of
the
barley
crop
.
Some
say
the
dough
in
women
's
hands
swelled
up
.
A
Tanna
taught
:
Great
was
the
calamity
that
befell
that
day
for
everything
at
which
R.
Eliezer
cast
his
eyes
was
burned
up
.
R.
Gamaliel
too
was
travelling
in
a
ship
when
a
huge
wave
arose
to
drown
him
.
'It
appears
to
me
'
he
reflected
'that
this
is
on
account
of
none
other
but
R.
Eliezer
b
.
Hyrcanus
.
'
Thereupon
he
arose
and
exclaimed
'Sovereign
of
the
Universe
!
Thou
knowest
full
well
that
I
have
not
acted
for
my
honour
nor
for
the
honour
of
my
paternal
house
but
for
Thine
so
that
strife
may
not
multiply
in
Israel
!
'At
that
the
raging
sea
subsided
.
Ima
Shalom
was
R.
Eliezer
's
wife
and
sister
to
R.
Gamaliel
.
From
the
time
of
this
incident
onwards
she
did
not
permit
him
to
fall
upon
his
face
.
Now
a
certain
day
happened
to
be
New
Moon
but
she
mistook
a
full
month
for
a
defective
one
.
Others
say
a
poor
man
came
and
stood
at
the
door
and
she
took
out
some
bread
to
him
.
[
On
her
return
]
she
found
him
fallen
on
his
face
.
'Arise
'
she
cried
out
to
him
'thou
hast
slain
my
brother
.
'
In
the
meanwhile
an
announcement
was
made
from
the
house
of
Rabban
Gamaliel
that
he
had
died
.
The
sages
came
to
the
correct
decision
about
the
law
;
the
only
puzzle
in
that
part
of
the
story
is
why
having
been
told
by
God
that
Eliezer
had
it
right
the
other
scholars
did
n't
all
change
their
opinion
accordingly
thus
changing
the
majority
vote
.
What
about
the
ban
?
That
corresponds
to
what
really
happened
in
the
conflict
between
the
two
schools—the
school
of
Hillel
won
out
and
effectively
suppressed
the
rival
school
.
The
story
seems
to
imply
that
that
outcome
was
wrong—or
if
right
catastrophically
right
resulting
in
mass
destruction
.
God
threatened
to
drown
the
leader
of
the
sages
for
his
role
in
what
happened
even
if
persuaded
not
to
and
God
did
kill
him
the
first
time
Eliezer
prayed—at
least
I
assume
that
's
what
``
falling
on
his
face
''
refers
to
.
Some
versions
I
have
seen
say
that
Eliezer
having
been
outvoted
continued
to
tell
his
followers
to
decide
cases
according
to
their
view
of
the
law
which
would
at
least
explain
the
ban
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
that
is
based
on
separate
evidence
or
someone
's
attempt
to
explain
the
story
.
With
any
luck
one
or
more
of
the
readers
of
the
post
will
be
more
familiar
with
the
subject
than
I
am
and
able
to
throw
some
light
on
the
second
half
of
the
story
.
Jewish
law
is
not
the
only
system
to
face
the
problem
of
establishing
consistent
law
based
on
an
authoritative
source
.
The
equivalent
problem
in
U.S.
law
is
constitutional
interpretation
and
the
solution
is
rather
like
the
Jewish
solution
.
A
judge
or
law
professor
is
free
to
argue
for
his
interpretation
of
the
Constitution
but
once
the
Supreme
Court
has
voted
on
the
subject
a
judge
is
required
to
rule
according
to
its
vote
.
Sharia
also
claims
to
be
deduced
from
religious
sources
rather
than
created
by
a
ruler
legislator
or
court
.
The
split
between
the
schools
of
Hillel
and
Shamai
in
Jewish
law
corresponds
to
the
division
among
the
four
schools
of
Sunni
Muslim
law
.
In
the
Muslim
case
Shamai
was
never
repressed
.
The
four
schools
continued
to
regard
each
other
as
mutually
orthodox
for
more
than
a
thousand
years—and
still
do
.
Which
suggests
that
legal
uniformity
may
be
less
essential
than
one
would
expect
.

``
Falling
on
his
face
''
refers
to
a
section
of
individual
petitionary
prayer
(
called
tachanun
)
at
the
end
of
the
Amidah
(
main
prayer
of
the
service
)
.
This
section
is
omitted
on
certain
days
including
the
new
moon
.
The
interpretation
I
learned
of
this
part
which
I
find
in
later
commentaries
but
not
in
the
gemara
itself
(
the
part
of
the
talmud
you
're
quoting
)
is
that
he
prayed
to
God
about
his
unhappiness
and
God
took
action
not
that
he
directly
prayed
for
any
ill
to
fall
to
Gamliel
.
(
Yes
that
's
some
challenging
theology
.
)
As
you
note
the
houses
of
Hillel
and
Shammai
disagreed
with
each
other
but
they
generally
coexisted
peacefully
.
I
'm
not
sure
this
was
surpression
of
Shammai
rather
than
surpression
of
a
beligerent
sage
.
Elsewhere
in
talmud
(
I
think
in
Eruvim
but
I
ca
n't
find
it
now
)
we
're
told
that
while
they
disagreed
they
got
along
intermarried
with
each
other
ate
in
each
others
'
homes
(
even
though
one
of
the
things
they
disagreedabout
was
kashrut
)
etc
.

I
did
link
to
the
source
although
only
fairly
far
down
in
the
post
.
The
notes
in
the
source
explain
about
falling
on
his
face
but
I
did
n't
want
to
go
into
that
much
detail
in
the
post
.

.
I
'm
pretty
sure
that
the
school
of
Shammai
was
in
fact
suppressed
.
At
least
the
account
I
've
seen
is
something
like
``
for
four
generations
the
two
schools
disagreed
in
peace
with
members
of
each
willing
to
eat
in
the
house
of
the
other
and
marry
their
daughters
.
''
The
implication
I
got
was
that
that
situation
eventually
changed
.
It
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
harder
to
sustain
a
situation
in
which
one
school
commanded
a
clear
majority
of
support
and
with
only
two
schools
one
is
likely
to
be
bigger
than
the
other
.
Perhaps
there
's
a
certain
balance
of
power
among
the
Sunni
schools
that
has
contributed
to
their
better
preservation
.
I
actually
did
a
post
on
this
story
a
few
years
ago
(
http
:
//izgad.blogspot.com/2007/09/hogwarts-school-of-force-studies-and.html
)
.
My
main
interest
in
it
is
the
implied
opposition
to
charismatic
leaders
and
their
claims
to
performing
miracles
.
Regardless
of
whether
Rabbi
Eliezer
could
perform
miracles
the
mere
proposition
that
any
individual
could
do
so
is
something
so
dangerous
for
established
religious
authority
that
it
has
to
be
repressed
.
In
terms
of
Beit
Shammai
being
suppressed
we
see
for
example
Rabbi
Tarfon
being
castigated
in
Brachot
for
following
the
dictates
of
Beit
Shammai
in
saying
the
Shma
prayer
.
That
being
said
Beit
Shammai
is
generally
used
as
an
example
of
rabbinic
inclusiveness
since
regardless
of
whether
rabbinic
Judaism
follows
Beit
Shammai
in
practice
their
opinions
are
still
accepted
as
legitimate
in
the
Talmud
as
opposed
to
say
the
Sadducees.Traditional
Judaism
has
its
version
of
different
schools
accepting
the
validity
of
each
other
.
For
example
Ashkenazic
and
Sephardi
halachic
traditions
are
very
different
but
still
accept
the
validity
of
the
other
.
Lithuanian
and
Hasidic
schools
of
thought
despite
their
strong
opposition
to
each
other
in
the
late
eighteenth
and
early
nineteenth
centuries
now
accept
the
other
.
Izgad
mentions
later
examples
of
mutually
orthodox
but
differing
schools
of
Jewish
law
.
I
believe
those
are
after
not
only
the
end
of
the
Sanhedrin
but
the
loss
of
effective
control
over
the
law
by
the
Babylonian
academies
--
at
a
point
at
which
there
was
no
way
of
establishing
legal
uniformity
.
I
am
not
certain
as
to
how
important
the
downturn
in
the
Babylonian
Academy’s
power
.
(
Keep
in
mind
that
there
was
no
sudden
collapse
but
a
decline
that
starts
somewhere
around
the
tenth
century
.
The
Academy
continues
to
exist
for
centuries
afterwards
.
)
Rabbinic
Judaism
successfully
managed
to
disassociate
itself
from
the
Karaites
.
The
move
is
connected
by
most
scholars
to
Saadiah
Gaon
in
the
tenth
century
.
Mythology
does
not
have
to
be
a
matter
of
believing
or
not
believing
.
It
can
simply
be
a
way
of
expressing
values
.
As
mythologies
go
this
is
a
good
one
to
have
;
it
is
a
rejection
of
supernatural
authority
.
We
no
longer
care
if
someone
can
perform
miracles
.
The
story
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
human
beings
can
overrule
God
.
If
one
is
going
to
try
building
a
humanist
religion
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
.
Izgad
's
point
is
a
good
one
.
Contemporary
Orthodoxy
is
very
ossified
;
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
change
and
existing
law
.
But
this
story
(
and
a
few
others
)
from
the
Talmud
reflect
the
flexibility
and
dynamism
of
the
system
at
least
at
that
time
.
It
shows
that
there
was
actually
a
common
law
system
of
law
in
place
;
there
was
respect
for
tradition
and
authority
but
new
rules
could
be
made
and
old
rules
could
be
changed
.
The
earliest
example
of
this
common-law
approach
actually
comes
from
the
Torah
itself
in
the
two
stories
about
the
Daughters
of
Zelophechad
in
the
Book
of
Numbers
.
I
have
blogged
about
the
legal
aspects
of
those
stories
here
and
here
.
I
have
loved
this
story
ever
since
I
first
read
it
(
horrors
)
40-odd
years
ago
.
Writing
an
article
about
miracles
I
thought
I
'd
bring
it
up
there
and
in
looking
commentary
on
it
came
across
this
blog
(
obviously
)
--
but
there
is
a
truly
brilliant
article
by
Daniel
Greenwood
here
:
http
:
//people.hofstra.edu/daniel_j_greenwood/html/Akhnai.htmthat
pulls
every
thread
out
of
it
you
can
imagine
(
and
quite
a
few
I
could
n't
have
)
.
Not
a
quick
read
but
wonderfully
rewarding
and
hugely
recommended
.
Thanks
for

the
online
Talmud
translation

authoritative
source

Fiction
is
fiction
--
the
Temple
was
gone
and
miracles
ceased
to
exist
--
therefore
this
is
a
tale
that
is
told
to
prove
a
point
.
Truth
be
known
--
did
this
really
happen
?
Could
it
occur
today
?
Very
doubtful
.
Did
it
happen
then
?
Another
bedtime
story
