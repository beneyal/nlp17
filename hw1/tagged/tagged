Saturday/NOUN ,/. July/NOUN 24/NUM ,/. 2010/NUM The/DET Furnace/NOUN of/ADP Akhnai/NOUN :/. Story/NOUN and/CONJ Puzzle/NOUN In/ADP studying/VERB Jewish/ADJ law/NOUN (/. for/ADP a/DET course/NOUN I/PRON teach/VERB on/ADP legal/ADJ systems/NOUN very/ADV different/ADJ from/ADP ours/PRON )/. ,/. I/PRON came/VERB across/ADP the/DET story/NOUN of/ADP the/DET furnace/NOUN (/. or/CONJ oven/NOUN )/. of/ADP Akhnai/NOUN ./.
In/ADP brief/ADJ :/. Rabbi/NOUN Eliezer/NOUN disputed/VERB with/ADP the/DET sages/NOUN as/ADP to/ADP whether/ADP a/DET clay/NOUN oven/NOUN that/PRON had/VERB become/VERB impure/NOUN ,/. had/VERB been/VERB broken/VERB up/PRT ,/. and/CONJ then/ADV reassembled/VERB with/ADP sand/NOUN between/ADP the/DET pieces/NOUN ,/. was/VERB still/ADV impure/NOUN or/CONJ ,/. having/VERB been/VERB broken/VERB ,/. was/VERB now/ADV pure/ADJ ./.
After/ADP he/PRON offered/VERB all/PRT of/ADP his/DET arguments/NOUN to/PRT show/VERB that/ADP the/DET oven/NOUN was/VERB now/ADV pure/ADJ and/CONJ they/PRON were/VERB all/PRT rejected/VERB ,/. he/PRON called/VERB upon/ADP a/DET carob/X tree/NOUN to/PRT prove/VERB the/DET truth/NOUN of/ADP his/DET position/NOUN ./.
The/DET carob/X tree/NOUN promptly/ADV uprooted/VERB itself/PRON and/CONJ was/VERB flung/VERB a/DET great/ADJ distance/NOUN away/ADV ./.
The/DET sages/NOUN responded/VERB that/ADP a/DET carob/X tree/NOUN had/VERB nothing/NOUN to/PRT say/VERB in/ADP the/DET disputes/NOUN of/ADP legal/ADJ scholars/NOUN ./.
The/DET argument/NOUN continues/VERB ,/. Eliezer/NOUN is/VERB supported/VERB by/ADP two/NUM more/ADJ miracles/NOUN ,/. each/DET of/ADP which/DET the/DET sages/NOUN insist/VERB is/VERB irrelevant/ADJ ./.
Finally/ADV he/PRON asks/VERB heaven/NOUN to/PRT support/VERB him/PRON ,/. and/CONJ a/DET voice/NOUN form/NOUN heaven/NOUN announces/VERB that/ADP in/ADP all/PRT matters/NOUN of/ADP the/DET law/NOUN Eliezer/NOUN is/VERB correct/ADJ ./.
To/PRT which/DET one/NUM of/ADP the/DET sages/NOUN replies/VERB (/. to/PRT God/NOUN )/. ``/. It/PRON is/VERB not/ADV in/ADP heaven/NOUN ./. ''/.

To/PRT make/VERB sense/NOUN of/ADP the/DET story/NOUN so/ADP far/ADV ,/. one/NUM needs/NOUN a/DET little/ADJ background/NOUN ./.
Jewish/ADJ law/NOUN ,/. like/ADP any/DET system/NOUN based/VERB on/ADP divine/ADJ revelation/NOUN ,/. has/VERB an/DET inherent/ADJ problem/NOUN with/ADP maintaining/VERB consistency/NOUN ./.
If/ADP the/DET law/NOUN is/VERB what/DET God/NOUN said/VERB ,/. and/CONJ different/ADJ judges/NOUN have/VERB different/ADJ interpretations/NOUN of/ADP what/DET that/PRON is/VERB ,/. then/ADV the/DET judges/NOUN will/VERB give/VERB different/ADJ rulings/NOUN on/ADP the/DET same/ADJ question/NOUN ./.
What/DET God/NOUN said/VERB is/VERB not/ADV determined/VERB by/ADP majority/NOUN vote/NOUN ./.

What/DET God/NOUN said/VERB was/VERB something/NOUN that/PRON each/DET legal/ADJ scholar/NOUN could/VERB determine/VERB for/ADP himself/PRON ./.
But/CONJ if/ADP they/PRON disagreed/VERB ,/. what/DET the/DET law/NOUN was/VERB was/VERB determined/VERB by/ADP majority/NOUN vote/NOUN of/ADP the/DET scholars/NOUN ./.
Better/ADV that/ADP they/PRON risk/NOUN getting/VERB the/DET law/NOUN wrong/ADJ than/ADP that/DET they/PRON end/VERB up/PRT disagreeing/VERB in/ADP their/DET judgments/NOUN ./.
A/DET scholar/NOUN who/PRON disagreed/VERB was/VERB free/ADJ to/PRT argue/VERB for/ADP his/DET position/NOUN ,/. but/CONJ when/ADV functioning/NOUN as/ADP a/DET judge/NOUN he/PRON had/VERB to/PRT decide/VERB according/ADP to/ADP the/DET view/NOUN that/PRON had/VERB been/VERB established/VERB by/ADP the/DET majority/NOUN ./.
The/DET story/NOUN is/VERB happening/VERB at/ADP the/DET end/NOUN of/ADP a/DET period/NOUN of/ADP several/ADJ generations/NOUN in/ADP which/DET the/DET legal/ADJ scholars/NOUN were/VERB divided/VERB into/ADP two/NUM schools/NOUN ,/. the/DET school/NOUN of/ADP Hillel/NOUN and/CONJ the/DET school/NOUN of/ADP Shamai/NOUN ,/. which/DET disagreed/VERB about/ADP details/NOUN of/ADP the/DET law/NOUN but/CONJ continued/VERB to/PRT each/DET treat/NOUN the/DET other/ADJ as/ADP legitimate/ADJ ./.
